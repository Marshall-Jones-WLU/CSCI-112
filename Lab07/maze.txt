Maze Analysis

I found that the stack is always more efficient than the queues.
In maze1.txt, it took the stack only 116 steps to solve the maze,
while it took 143 steps for the ArrayQ.

Similarly in maze2.txt, it took the stack 14 steps, whereas the
queue took over double the number of steps at 35.

maze3.txt did not work for any of my storage types â€“ ArrayQueue,
LinkedQueue, and LinkedStack.

In the stack's approach to solving the maze, it chose one direction
to go at a time. When it hit a road block, it backtracked to the last
point where it could have turned. I found this to be more efficient than
the queues, which tried all possibilities at the same time. 

Even if the stack happened to choose the wrong path every time except for 
its last possibility, it would still finish the maze in the same number of 
steps as the queues.

Overall, both types of storage seem to have the same success rate, but the
stack seems to be the most efficient in general.
